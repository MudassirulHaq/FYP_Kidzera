# FYP_Kidzera
*This is an FYP project for SZABIST university (class of 2019) created by Syed Mudassir Ul Haq & Saad Altaf.*

*‘KidzEra’* The main objective of KidzEra is for children to enjoy education from the comfort of their own home. The basic idea is children will be able to turn their education into a gamified learning experience with the help of AR. They will have access to an ABC Book where a child can go through the alphabets via AR by showing them a respective model associated with the letter for example the letter C will display a small cat. Along with this they will be provided a description about the letter. The children will also be able to test their knowledge with a quiz in the application where they will have two options to choose from. Apart from the ABC Book we have an AR Zoo. This feature will allow children to roam around in their own home and look for animals sparking curiosity. And to make it more enjoyable we have added a score and a timer for a child to give them the motivation to find all the animals present. Lastly we have also added a scoreboard to allow parents to check how their child is doing regarding our games and quiz.
